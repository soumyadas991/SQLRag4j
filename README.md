# SQL-RAG with Annotated Queries and LLM Integration

This project enables developers to create SQL-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines by simply annotating methods in their Java code. It allows integration with various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI and LLAMA.) and supports flexible query generation and execution using LangChain4j.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔖 **@LLMQuery Annotation**: Easily annotate methods to define SQL-based prompts for LLMs.
- 🧠 **LLM Provider Agnostic**: Plug in OpenAI, Cohere, or any other LLM service.
- 🗃️ **Dynamic SQL Access**: Generate SQL dynamically via LLMs based on natural language inputs.
- 🔐 **Environment-Based Config**: Provide DB and API keys via environment variables.
- 🧩 **Embeddable Library**: Designed as a JAR that can be imported into any Spring Boot app.
